title: "Week 3: Concluding the Extension Activity"
---

I found that working on the browser extension with my group was surprisingly exciting. I know it was supposed to be a mini-project focused on getting us to use git as a tool but I'm surprised how fun throwing three strangers together on a low-stakes project was!

We came up with a non-serious solution to a non-existing problemâ€”turning normal text into mOcK tExT. I think it was incredibly helpful that the focus of the project did not lie upon the project idea; it made the communication and collaboration quite easy, because everyone was willing to have fun with it.

This was also the first time I really put an effort into caring about the proper licensing of the project. There were a couple moments I was confused as to what license I should use. It also raised a lot of questions about licensing that I would have never encountered had I not actually done a mini-project with an emphasis on the documentation. So while I was familiar with the tools, this assignment was a good exercise in thoroughness for me. 

I found the other presentations quite enjoyable as well; everyone seemed to have either picked something they would find useful or something they found was entertaining. I found the "Table of Contents" extension to actually be particularly handy and something I would potentially download for myself.

Overall, although I didn't have any life changing revelations from working on this project, I did have a good time, met new people, and can now say I have worked on an extension!
